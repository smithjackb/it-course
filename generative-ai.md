# Introduction to Generative AI

Welcome to the Generative AI module. This section covers the fundamentals, architectures, and tools used in modern generative systems.

---

## 1. What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to systems capable of generating text, images, code, music, and more using models trained on large datasets.

---

## 2. Applications of Generative AI

- Text generation (e.g., ChatGPT)
- Image synthesis (e.g., DALLÂ·E, Midjourney)
- Music composition
- Drug discovery
- Data augmentation

---

## 3. Understanding Probability and Statistics in Generative AI

Core concepts:
- Random variables and probability distributions
- Bayesian inference
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- KL Divergence and entropy

---

## 4. Introduction to Generative Models

Generative models learn the joint probability distribution of data. Types include:
- Naive Bayes
- Hidden Markov Models
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- GANs

---

## 5. Deep Learning for Generative Models

Deep learning uses neural networks (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers) to model complex data distributions, enabling realistic outputs.

---

## 6. Introduction to GANs

Generative Adversarial Networks consist of:
- Generator: Creates fake data
- Discriminator: Distinguishes fake vs real  
They play a minimax game to improve each other.

---

## 7. Autoencoders

Autoencoders compress and reconstruct data:
- Encoder maps input to latent space
- Decoder reconstructs data from latent space
Used in noise removal, dimensionality reduction, etc.

---

## 8. Transformers and Attention Mechanisms

The "Attention is All You Need" paper introduced:
- Self-attention for capturing sequence relationships
- Transformer architecture now powers GPT, BERT, etc.
